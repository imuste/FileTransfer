The internet is a computer network that connects billions of devices across the world and these devices are called hosts or endsystems. All endsystems are connected through a network of communication links and packet switches. Different links have different transmission rates measured in bits/seconds. When a sending endsystem segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment, after which the packet is sent and reassembled by the destination endsystem.
A packet switch will take a packet from one of its incoming communication links and forward this to one of its outgoing communication links. The communication links and packet switches that a packet passes through from its sender to its destination is a route through the network. The most prominent types of packet switches today are routers (used in the network core) and link-layer switches (used in access networks).
