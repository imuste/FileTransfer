HTTP is the protocol that is used to get things over the web. Traditionally HTTP used TCP because it provides the reliability and in-order delivery that we need and we can deal with the overhead that comes with it. The newer versions of HTTP are starting to use different transport services such as QUIC to help solve some of this overhead for the speed.
When you fetch a web page for example, you have a human readable name, but this is converted to an IP address through DNS. The web page address has a host name (cs.tufts.edu) that shows the name of the server where the web page is loaded. Then the rest is the path to the actual page that we want to get (user/index.html).
HTTP is stateless which means that the client needs to fetch objects and the server does not keep any state or information about the requests it gets which means that each request is completely separate. So if we request a cs.tufts.edu/user/index.html page, the server is not going to remember that request after it completes it.
